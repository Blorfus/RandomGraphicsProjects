## Processing Sketches
(editor can be found at processing.org)

**VisByte** - A processing program that draws bytes from a string. Fun to look at. 
**Cyrcles** - Screwing around with "fractals" & recursion
**Points** - Create a bunch of points, make them do things, testing out classes & functions. Move your mouse around for this one, I dare you.
